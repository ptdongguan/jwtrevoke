script to do  koa-jwt revoke
since i spend almost one day to do koa keep one login only.
share here.
logic is simple.

1.every login do user increase signid++;
2.set isrevoked to jwt middleware (it is promise); check/load the user data;
3. compare token inside signid and current the user.signid.if not equal return true (means invalidate)
